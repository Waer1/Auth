# Authentication Methods Repository

This repository contains code for implementing three different authentication methods in web applications. Each authentication method is organized into a separate folder. The three authentication methods are as follows:

1. **Session Authentication**
   - Folder: `session-auth`
   - Description: This folder contains code and resources related to session-based authentication. Session authentication is a traditional and widely used method for user authentication in web applications. It involves creating and managing user sessions using cookies or other mechanisms.

2. **Passport.js with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Authentication**
   - Folder: `passport-jwt-auth`
   - Description: In this folder, you will find code and resources for implementing authentication using Passport.js with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Passport.js is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js, and JWT is a stateless authentication method that is often used for securing RESTful APIs.

3. **Passport.js with Session Authentication**
   - Folder: `passport-session-auth`
   - Description: The `passport-session-auth` folder contains code and resources for implementing authentication using Passport.js with session management. This method combines Passport.js, a flexible authentication middleware, with session-based authentication for web applications.
